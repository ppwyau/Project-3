# Project 3 Overview
# Requirements
For Project 3, you will work with your group on one of two different track options: data visualizations or data engineering.

# Data Visualization Track
For this track, your group will tell a story using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:

Your project must include visualizations. The visualizations can be created with:

Python (e.g. Matplotlib, Pandas plotting, hvplot)

JavaScript (e.g. Plotly or Leaflet)

A Python or JavaScript visualization library that was not covered in class

Data must be stored in and extracted from at least one database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc).

Your project must include at least one JavaScript OR Python library that we did not cover.

Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction, such as:

HTML menus, dropdowns, and/or textboxes to display JavaScript-powered visualizations

Flask backend with interactive API routes that serve back Python or JavaScript created plots

Visualizations created from user-selected filtered data, which could be powered by:

JavaScript libraries

Python in Jupyter Notebook

Command-line Python scripts that save visualizations locally

Remember: You have learned how to filter data in Pandas, JavaScript, SQL, SQLAlchemy, and MongoDB.

If possible, your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

Your GitHub repo must include a README.md with an outline of the project including:

An overview of the project and its purpose

Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

References for the data source(s)

References for any code used that is not your own

# Instructions on how to use and interact with the project:
# Launch the Dashboard: Open the interactive dashboard by running the Python script  applicable).
-  Use Filters: Use the dropdown menus and checkboxes to filter the data by month, weather conditions, urban or rural areas, and other available options.
-  Explore Visualizations: View different charts like bar graphs, scatter plots, and heatmaps to analyze accident patterns.
-  Hover for Details: Hover over data points on graphs to see detailed information (e.g., number of accidents, severity).
-  Interpret Responsibly: Use the insights for educational or policy purposes, keeping in mind the limitations noted in the project.
-  Technical Requirements: Make sure you have the required libraries installed (e.g., Pandas, hvPlot, Panel, Chrome browser). Use a Jupyter Notebook or Python environment to run the code if running locally.


# Efforts for ethical considerations made in the project:
In our group project analyzing road accidents in the UK, we have made several efforts to address ethical considerations to ensure responsible handling of data. 
- Firstly, we prioritize the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information, ensuring that personally identifiable data, such as accident victims' details, is not included in the dataset or visualizations. 
-	We aim to focus solely on anonymized data, such as accident severity, road conditions, and contributing factors. 
-	Additionally, we emphasize the responsible use of data to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes, ensuring that our analysis does not unfairly stigmatize certain regions or groups. 
-	Our visualizations will aim to present clear, objective insights that can guide policymakers and road safety professionals without misrepresenting or oversimplifying complex factors involved in road accidents. 
-	Furthermore, we are committed to transparent and accurate reporting of our findings, acknowledging the limitations of our analysis and ensuring that our recommendations are based on robust and unbiased data analysis.

# Data analysis limitations:
1.	Data Completeness: Some data may be missing or incomplete, affecting accuracy.
2.	Data Quality: Inconsistent reporting may impact reliability.
3.	Bias in Reporting: Not all accidents are reported, leading to potential underrepresentation.
4.	Geographic Scope: The data only covers the UK, so regional differences may not be captured.
5.	Temporal Constraints: The analysis is limited to 2021 and may not reflect long-term trends.
6.	External Factors: Factors like human behavior or vehicle maintenance are not included.
